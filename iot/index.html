Elliot needs a way to get access to eCorp conference system so that he can get further inside information.<br>
A portrait photographer, relative of Philip Price, that goes by the name of "megapixelprice" in the social networks, is currently onsite doing some photoshoots for them.<br>
Elliot managed to fool him to update his shiny new camera with a malicious firmware and currently has remote access to the camera API. Maybe this can help to gather further info. Can you help him?<br>
